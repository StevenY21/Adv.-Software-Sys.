Compiling: After getting into the folder, run make, it should compile everything. If it doesn't the Makefile commands should all work.

Testing: I used the file called test. The stats have been manually produced with something like ./program_name insert_args >> stats.
Note: Do $cat stats to see the stats without any weird symbols popping up.

Don't forget to run export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/full/path/to/library/directory:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} in order for the shared library to work

Configuration: 4 core, 8 processor, 2.4 GHz (2.419 MHz), Intel Processor. The 2419 is apparently the one computed by Windows, but 2.40 is the official one.
