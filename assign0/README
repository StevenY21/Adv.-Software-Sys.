Compiling: After getting into the folder, run make, it should compile everything.

Testing: I used the file called test. The stats have been manually produced with something like ./program_name insert_args >> stats.
Note: Do $cat stats to see the stats without any weird symbols popping up. Also getcopy is not in stats as the main output is sent to text-output

Using the programs:
./getsections insert_filename
./getsections_dl insert_filename insert_flagname*
./getsyms insert_filename
./getsyms_dl insert_filename insert_flagname*
./getcopy insert_filename
./getcopy_dl insert_filename insert_flagname*
* The flagname and filenames are interchangeable, just type the flagname like a regular word like RTLD_LAZY and RTLD_NOW.

Don't forget to run export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/full/path/to/library/directory:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} in order for the libraries to work.

Configuration: 4 core, 8 processor, 2.4 GHz, Intel Processor.
