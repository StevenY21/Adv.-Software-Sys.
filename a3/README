#Assignment 3  
##Setup  
What you will need:  
-Just run make in terminal
-Maybe install the python libraries that are mentioned in audioanalyze.cgi and my-histogram.cgi
##Requests  
The webserver can work for the following requests:  
-localhost:port-number/request.jpg  
-localhost:port-number/request.gif  
-localhost:port-number/request.cgi  
-localhost:port-number/my-histogram directory  
Yes there's a space in the my-histogram request. 
Note: my-histogram only works with the director the the server's in or the immediate directories inside that directory. 
Doing dir/dir on valid directories would generate the jpg, but wont send it in the response as the / messes with the url.

##For hardware  
Plug in the hardware to serial after starting the server, then afterwards immediately give the audioanalyze.cgi request.  
The program will finish processing after you've been silent for 5 seconds  
Makesure you have the sketch running so that it does what it's supposed to immediately upon being plugged in  

#ENJOY!
