Assignment 1:
Only has the finds program. The finds program can, as of right now, only support the '.', '?', and '*' wildcards inside the string expression. 
I am not certain if my wildcard implementation covers all possible combinations. 
The structure of the cmd is ./finds -p pathname [-f c|h|S] [-l] -s s.
